# Prompt Battle App

## Set up

- Install the dependencies via `npm install`

## During the event:

As a temporary workaround, we recommend running the app in _dev mode_ during the event:

`npm run dev` will share the application with the network, so different clients (contestants, battle admin, etc.) can access the app.
