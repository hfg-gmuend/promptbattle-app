# Prompt Battle App

## Set up

1. Install the dependencies via `npm install`
2. Configure your txt2img APIs! Create an `.env` File and add the necessary environment variables, e.g. for DALL-E you would need to set OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_ORG_ID

## During the Prompt Battle event:

As a temporary workaround, we recommend running the app in (Vite's) _dev mode_ during the event:

`npm run dev` will share the application with the network, so different clients (contestants, battle admin, etc.) can access the app.
